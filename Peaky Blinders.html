        The Peaky Blinders were a street gang based in Birmingham,
         England, that operated from the end of the 19th century to the early 1900s. 
         The group, which grew out of the harsh economic deprivations
          of working class Britain, was composed largely of young men of lower to
           middle-classes. They derived social power from robbery, violence, racketeering, 
           illegal bookmaking and the control of gambling. Members of this gang wore
            a signature outfit that included tailored jackets, lapel overcoats, button waistcoats,
             silk scarves, bell-bottom trousers, leather boots, and peaked flat caps.

        The Blinders' dominance came about from beating rivals, such as the "Sloggers", whom
         they fought for territory in Birmingham and its surrounding districts. 
         They held control for nearly 20 years until 1910, when a larger gang, the Birmingham
          Boys led by Billy Kimber, overtook them. However, even though they had disappeared by the 1920s, 
          the name of the "Peaky Blinders" became synonymous slang for any street gang in Birmingham.

</p>

<p>
   <b>Tommy </b>served in World War I with the rank of Sergeant Major
     and was decorated for bravery. His experiences in World War
      I left him disillusioned and beset with ongoing nightmares,
       and he becomes determined to move his family up in the world.
 <p>
     <br>
 </p>      
After the vendetta with the New York Mafia, and during the year
 of the Wall Street Crash, Thomas Shelby became a Member of 
 Parliament as a socialist politician while lending the chair of
  the illegal business to his older brother,<b>Arthur Shelby.</b>

    Arthur is the eldest of the Shelby siblings and a tough

      of Shelby Company Limited and member of the ICA,
       acting as his brother Tommy Shelby's right-hand man.
<p>
    <br>
</p>
    After returning from France, Arthur feels that he should
     be the head of the family business. However, he can't command
      the necessary authority and Thomas slowly starts to assume leadership.

 After John, Arthur and Thomas return from the war,
 they take over control of the Blinders, with Thomas

 the matriarch and heart of the family. 
 <p>
     <br>
 </p>
 Thomas keeps many things close to his chest, such as the fact
that his men accidentally acquired the wrong crate during a routine
 pick-up, instead of taking a crate that contained Lewis machine guns.
Polly is the only one that Thomas will confide in. When she is eventually
able to wheedle the information out of him, she tells him to dump the
guns before he gets hanged for having them.

 southward expansion of the Shelby Family business to London,
 stating that he doesn’t want to change things as 
 their business is already successful and that expanding
the business is a dangerous idea.

 Thomas offers him a chance to leave his title and the

     After seeing Arthur's violent episodes many times, and with
      the suggestion from his brother Thomas, Finn introduces Arthur
       to a drug called Tokyo (cocaine), and tells him to only 
       use it during race days and special occasions.
<p>

 They take Finn with them to the Epsom races, 
 where Arthur,John and the gang hold up

You mess with the Peaky Blinders and you get a bloodied face and a burnt bar.
 At least, if you anger Arthur, the loud-mouthed, hot-headed brother of family patriarch Thomas Shelby. The context of this iconic quote comes from a scene where Arthur's cousin Michael is out at a bar with his friend. But the racist bar throws them out as Michael's friend is a black man

  <b> “Everyone’s a where, Grace. We just sell different parts of ourselves.” </b>
<i>
— Tommy Shelby
    </pre>
In the early days, before Tommy and Grace fell in love, 
Tommy wanted to use Grace's charm and beauty to win 
over Billy Kimber. When Grace learned of Tommy's true intentions
 of inviting her along to a race, she accused
  him of prostituting her for his own gain.
   This was his witty response.

The truth of it is, 
he's not wrong. We all sell ourselves 
to get what we want, just in different ways.

   <b>“Whisky’s good proofing water. Tells you who’s real and who isn’t.”</b>
<i>
-- Tommy Shelby
    </pre>
We can't deny the truth behind this statement from Thomas Shelby himself. He uses this booze-induced trick to find out the truth behind other's intentions -- particularly his enemies.

Alcohol -- especially whiskey -- tends to loosen the inhibitions and lips of those who you need to see for who they really are. And no one knows that better than Tommy.

-Chester Campbell
    </pre>
A villain so bad that he's good. That's Sam Neill's Inspector Campbell.
 Initially, he has a vendetta against Thomas just because he's 
 on the other side of the law. But then he falls in love with
  undercover police agent Grace who is actually smitten with Thomas himself. 
  Campbell wages his own personal war after falling in this love triangle.

In this quote, Campbell stresses that no matter 
what romantic dreams Thomas weaves, he is bound to lose Grace.
 After all, Thomas has chosen a dangerous life for himself which
  makes it hard to have any real commitments. And Campbell does
   turn out to be right a few seasons later with Grace's
    fate as we find out a few seasons later.

    The show-runners of Peaky Blinders have a usual
     trope of putting Thomas in near-death situations 
     towards the season finale. This is the case in 
     the last episode of Season 2. Inspector Campbell's words
      ring true to Thomas who feels he's about to die.
       He laments on how he had finally found the love of
        his life and still, this gangster could not get his fairy tale ending

-Alfie Solomons
    </pre>
    <i>
Tom Hardy's addition to the show's cast as Jewish gangster-businessman Alfie was a welcome move. A wise yet witty character, his lines were mostly humorous until this moment. Thomas's son is kidnapped and he suspects Alfie. So, Thomas holds him at gunpoint, guilt-tripping him for his crimes. But Alfie in this angry monologue counter-questions Thomas's life choices.

No matter how heroic Thomas might act, he's still a ruthless gangster in the end. Hence, he and Alfie Solomons are no different.

    “Good taste is for people who can’t afford sapphires.”

    — Tommy Shelby

 <i>
    By the beginning of the third season,
     Tommy Shelby and the Peaky Blinders as
      a whole are flush with cash. They don't
       have to want for anything and Tommy makes
        sure his wife, Grace, has everything she deserves.
         That includes humungous sapphires.
    
    When he receives them as payment from the Russians,
     he makes one into a gorgeous necklace for her to wear 
     to their charity event. She remarks that likely wouldn't 
     be tasteful to wear to a charity event when he replies 
     with this one-liner. It was a stunning piece of jewelry, 
     so who needs good taste?

    <i>
Grace and Thomas's love story is almost Shakespearean.
 Initially, Grace poses as a barmaid and Thomas finds solace in her company
  A constant drinker, Thomas heads out to his pub in
   an empty hour and asks if Grace can raise a toast. 
   She says that she's Irish so she can make a million toasts.

Grace knows that Thomas has committed enough 
sins to go to hell, but she still looks at some of the
 niceness that he conceals. And this is what drives 
 her to our protagonist.

Alfie Solomons may be a vicious gangster 
who only looks out for himself, but many fans 
of Peaky Blinders look at him as a fan-favorite.
 He's hilarious in his demeanor and dialogue and 
 Tom Hardy plays him to perfection.

This quote is one of the more wise phrases uttered by Alfie.
 He is always ten steps ahead and this proves why. 
 Intelligence is something to be valued and only 
 the smart prevail in their world.

Arthur has a different philosophy altogether 
when it comes to matters of heaven and hell. 
Although Arthur faces PTSD and addiction issues, later on, 
he has mostly been a wild beast on the loose. 
This line only expands on his fits of bloodlust and rage.

If one had to compare gangster characters, 
Arthur would clearly be a distant relative to 
Joe Pesci from Goodfellas or The Godfather's Sonny Corleone!

   Thomas calmly says that if they're going to fight with guns,
    they should use 'proper guns'.

And it's then when Thomas's brother-in-law and fellow war veteran,
 Freddie comes out with a stolen Chinese machine gun in hand. 
 Kimber and his henchmen are stunned. Even though not much gunfire
  happens after this, Freddie's entry itself makes the scene cool enough.

After something happened to Tommy's new prized horse,
 he had to suddenly put it out of its misery.
  He then goes straight to The Garrison to get

She sings for him and the two become even closer.
 But not before she asks about his horse and he tells 
 her the truth. Mostly. That may not be the real

  also let her know he's a dangerous man.

It's Thomas's wedding day. 
It's funny to see the Shelbys interact with Grace's family,
 most of whom are members of the British Army. 
 Shelby just hopes that none of his kin embarrasses
  him in front of his in-laws so he takes his brothers and mates
   in the kitchen to give them some instructions.

The instructions range from not snorting cocaine, 
not firing any guns, and absolutely no fighting. 
This line plays out funnily and is easy 'meme-material'.

This is a simple and direct line, 
capturing the fear that the Peaky Blinders

  Inspector Campbell continues to bother the Shelby's

  undeterred and issues a straight threat at him.
   You just don't mess with the Peaky Blinders.

Just like 'by the order of the Peaky Blinders',
 this too became a common quote among the franchise's fans.
  Unfortunately, Campbell was the only one who never took these words seriously!
